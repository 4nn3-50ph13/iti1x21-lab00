### Important remarks!

We are using automated scripts to test and grade your lab submission.
Therefore, you must follow these instructions exactly.

In particular:

* Your naming of all the files and methods must be exact.
* Use the the starter code provided during the lab to avoid problems.
* Refer to announcements in BrightSpace for any corrections
* All source files must be present and must compile
  * That is, running javac \*.java must not produce any errors even if you were unable to complete an exercise.

Note the starter code for some exercises do not compile due to
syntax errors. So even if you could not solve this exercise
completely, you have to hand in a file with the methods intact that compiles
(for example, you can put "return 0;" if you gave up).

### Submissions

Your submission is due by the Tuesday 11:00pm the week after the lab.
